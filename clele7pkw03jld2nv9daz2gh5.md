# Android Development: Libraries to boost app development

Android Library

App development, it’s not just about coding, developers need to make apps efficient with faster performances for their features with fewer boilerplate codes. With the help of libraries, we can assert certain behaviors in the app that help to improve their functionalities. So, as I mentioned in my previous article about app performance libraries also play influential roles in app performance. You can check out this article about app performance.

> **Always use properly maintained libraries at minimized level.**

This article is all about some of the latest android libraries that are commonly used for app development. Before moving on let’s take a quick look at what is libraries.

### Android Library

A library is a container of behavioral implementations written in a programming language such as C, Kotlin, Java, etc… which simplifies the development process. In simple terms, it is a collection of prewritten code that automates tasks. It consists of class, data, pre-written code, values, message templates, and documentation.

In the context of Android, An android library is structurally the same as an android app module that compiles into an Android Archive(AAR). It can include everything needed to build an app, including app source code, resource files, and a manifest.

### Use of Android library

1.  **Reusability**: One of the major advantages is that because the android library is a collection of all pre-written codes, activities, resources, and fragments we can simply call it to another project or module by simply adding dependency no need to do all things from zero.
2.  **Global access:** When it is published using Maven, JitPack, and GitHub packages it can be accessed by others in their project.
3.  **Less boilerplate code**
4.  **Faster App Development**

Now let’s get into some of the most used libraries nowadays:

### Retrofit

Networking is important in android development. Firstly it was done in the main thread which slows down the application. To solve it Google introduced the Volley library after the Honeycomb version. Then Volley library is replaced by a type-safe **HTTP** **Networking Library called Retrofit** developed by Square for Android and Java which offered better functionality and better performance and simpler syntax. It is built on top of OKHttp as a networking layer. Finding JSON or XML data from API is made simple by this.

To use in Android studio

Add these dependencies in the build.gradle (Module level)

dependencies **{  
      ..........**

 implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0'  
}

To know more about Retrofit you can check the official documentation

### Dagger2

Dependency injection is basically a technique in which an object(dependent) requires another object(dependencies) to complete the process. So in android development to avoid coupling(tightly linked to each other) we need Dagger 2 which is an upgraded version of Dagger 1. Dagger is a **Dependency injection Library** created by Google**.** Dagger uses dependency graphs when compiling and uses annotation processing.

To implement in Android add it in build.gradle(Module level)

dependencies **{  
      ..........**

implementation 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android:2.17'     
kapt 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.17' 

```
// we add this so we can use the android support libraries
```

implementation 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-support:2.17'    kapt 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-processor:2.17'  

}

Read the documentation to adapt it to your android project

### Koin

It is a **dependency injection** framework written in Kotlin. We can construct classes and instruct Koin on how to create dependencies and can call anytime as needed.

To get started with Koin add the dependencies in the build.gradle(Module level)

dependencies **{  
      ..........**

implementation "org.koin:koin-android:3.2.0"  
implementation 'org.koin:koin-androidx-viewmodel:3.2.0'  
implementation 'org.koin:koin-androidx-scope:3.2.0'

}

### Hilt

The hilt is a **dependency injection library** created by Google**.** Hilt makes easy integration of dagger dependencies. Hilt is integrated with Jetpack libraries and Android framework classes which help to focus on defining and injecting bindings, not on dagger setup or wiring.

Add the dependencies in build.gradle(Module level)

dependencies {  
           ........

```
`implementation` 'com.google.dagger:hilt-android-gradle-plugin:2.38.1'  
      
}
```

To know more read the documentation

### Room

The room is a **persistent library** that is a part of Google’s Android Jetpack. As a persistent library, it means that it is a library that stores and retains data even after power to the device are cut off. The room library allows for the development of offline apps. It allows performing read/write operations. The Room is an SQLite object mapping library which builds to assist in implementing local SQLite database transactions. The room provides compile time checks of SQLite statements and returns RxJava, Flowable, and LiveData observables.

To implement include the dependencies in the build.gradle(Module level)

dependencies {  
           ........

implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:2.4.1"                annotationProcessor "androidx.room:room-compiler:2.4.1"

}

To know more read the following documentation.

### Glide

Glide is an **Image Loading Library** developed by bumptech that primarily focuses on scrolling any list of images smoothly and faster. Glide usually reuses and avoids unnecessary allocations. It supports fetching, decoding, and decoding video stills, images, and animated GIFs. Glide is more memory-efficient because it loads images according to the size of the view.

To set up add build.gradle (Module level)

dependencies {  
           .........

  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.13.2'  
  annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.13.2'  
}

### Picasso

Picasso is also an **Image Loading Library** managed by Square. Picasso helps in simplifying image loading from external URLs. Picasso supports complex image transformations, automatic caching, and download cancellation in an adapter. The Picasso handles every stage of the process from the initial HTTP request to caching of the image.

Use the dependency in build.gradle(Module level) to have the features of the Picasso library

dependencies **{  
      ..........** implementation ‘com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.5.2’  
}

### ExoPlayer

ExoPlayer is a **media player library** developed by Google. It is an alternative to Android MediaPlayer API. It is used for audio and video streaming on Android with lots of customizable features.

Add the dependency in your build.gradle(Module level)project to use the ExoPlayer in your android application.

```
dependencies **{**  
    **...**  
    implementation 'com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer:2.10.5'  
**}**
```

Check out the official Google developers documentation for more details.

[https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/exoplayer)

### Espresso

It is a **testing library** used to write concise, beautiful, and reliable UI tests released by Google. Espresso test runs on an actual Android device or emulator (Instrumentation testing). UI testing is basically done to check whether UI components like text fields, buttons, labels, and other components give the desired performance when actions are triggered. It can test a single application and also test outside applications as black box testing( Test only functionality. If the component gives the expected result then the test passes otherwise test fails).

To use in Android we need to include the following implementation in build.gradle(Module level)

plugins {  
    id("com.android.application")  
}  
  
android {  
  
    defaultConfig {  
         .......

        testInstrumentationRunner = "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"  
    }  
}  
  
dependencies {  
      .......

    androidTestImplementation('androidx.test:runner:1.4.0')  
    androidTestImplementation('androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.4.0')  
}
