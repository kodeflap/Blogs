# How to start programming for beginners

Zero is said to be a baseless value when talking. But sometimes itâ€™s hitting differently when it came to a unit for measuring your experience, knowledge, skills, etcâ€¦ The impact of **Zero** at that time is hard to digest. But itâ€™s a reality. The only thing to improve that unit is to put in some effort. Effort rules are painful but always pay for you. It will never let you in Zero anymore it raises that unit.

Every programmer came from zero bases of knowledge, if you are a computer science student who rates yourself with zero base or a person who never knows about programming but wishes to explore in tech field so this article will guide you to it.

### **Steps To Level Up ZeroÂ Base**

1.  ***Start by learning fundamentals concepts***

When you buy electronic items you don't have any clue about how it works. What happens when you donâ€™t use an instruction manual? You can already think about what happens next. To avoid the mess, it is better to understand how it works. So thatâ€™s the reason why I suggest is to understand the basics is that it always helps to make a firm understanding of how programs work. Strong knowledge of fundamentals helps to find the correct application of each item.

***Fundamental Concepts to learn***

> Basic syntax, Variables, Keywords, Operators, Decisions Making, Loops, Numbers, String, Array, Functions

***Some helpful resource***

***2\.*** [***Choose a programming language***](https://medium.com/@Codeduo/programming-languages-to-learn-in-2022-to-kickstart-your-coding-6766c65f458e)

When you lay down the foundation it is better to get started but there are already many programming languages now so how to choose one? You can look up the article â€œ [**5 Programming languages to learn in 2022"**](https://medium.com/@Codeduo/programming-languages-to-learn-in-2022-to-kickstart-your-coding-6766c65f458e)**.**

Find your perfect programming language. Now it's time to apply those fundamentals in your favorite language. Study according to your preferred methods through books or sites. Here are my personal choice of sites help to improve:

*   [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
*   [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
*   [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/)
*   [Programs](https://www.programiz.com/)

***3\. Do coding practice on competitive sites***

Now, this step can be followed with step 2 because an application with studying helps to level up and understand better. Below are some suggestions for your coding practice

*   [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)
*   [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
*   [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)
*   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
*   [GeeksforGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/)

Decide how many questions you want to solve. Start with easy then switch to medium when you feel comfortable solving hard questions. The key to improvement is to learn from your mistakes.

***4\. Data Structure and Algorithms***

When I first heard about it I also like, why would we need it? I know about the program! so why?????. This self-asked question gets answered when I entered the real application of programming. When you do the 3 steps you can call yourself a developer but to become a shining diamond among carbon then it is a must undergone step.

Either than the motive of breaking top MNC interviews data structure and algorithm helps in creating a programmer who provides a better solution. We can solve any problem in any number of ways but we always prefer the solution which helps in solving quickly with a better result.

You can feel the difference when you test yourself in the interview for the coding round and pass all the test cases. The moment you get a real programmer feel. OOPsâ€¦.. I have taken this too seriously so back to realityðŸ¤£.

I suggest finding your way of studying. Here are some recommendations which help you to pass through this step.

*   [Programs](https://www.programiz.com/)
*   [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)

***5\. Do some projects***

This is the step where your all learning is tested. You can choose any projects that came to your mind. No matter it's a Game, Ecommerce, Web Application, or Mobile application.

Choose a project according to your interest if you are Gamer try to build something like that, if you are an art, music, or foodie lover try to build some projects related to it. When interest explodes in that project you will know every single code that you made. If you get stuck at some point get some help from Google, friends, or whatever source you find.

### **Additional paths to level up toÂ Expert**

To fuel up your skill you always need extra boosting so getting involved in the following helps to improve you and make you an extraordinary software developer. I will be also providing them with a detailed view of the following paths deeply in the next blog:

*   Hackathons
*   Freelancing
*   Open Source Projects
*   Competitive Programming

The above suggestions in this article are purely the steps that I would choose if I want to start once again from the scratch. Hope you all like this blog. Letâ€™s discover the spark of our programming. Wishing you all luck with your coding journey.
