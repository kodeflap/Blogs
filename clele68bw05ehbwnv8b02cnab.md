# Worst 3 programming habits that get you stuck in a loop.

A loop??? Yes, there is a loop that every programmer makes without realizing which costs a lot of time and effort. Sometimes programmer also feels incomplete and questions about do it bring any impact on you. This article is all about what are the small mistakes or habits that you are repeatedly doing in your development career. So, are you still doing this?

#### **1\. Depending too much on Tutorials**

Next, go directly to the youtube search bar by typing the project name then ***spend hours*** scrolling through **playlists** with sleepy eyes and watching tutorials. Rolling up your sleeves and following every single instruction given and finally r***un your app***.

Scenario

1\. App loading‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

App crashes, Build with error, Null pointer exception, etc‚Ä¶üòµ.  
   
Then feels exhausted, repeatedly looping through the playlist, goes to StackOverflow for answers, Typing Google how to solve and pasting errors.

2\. App launcheüë©‚Äçüíª.....

Move towards the next app, takes the next youtube playlist repeat....the same process.

So, what is the main point of it spending lots of hours, and if you repeat the same loop?

**2\. Simply copy-pasting solutions without knowing the purpose**

This process is undoubtedly liked by many. But actually, does it make an impact on you saying no. It will make you repeatedly do the same even if you find the same error without understanding what is it.

If the app throws exceptions or deprecation messages undoubtedly our hands turn to copy then paste I search bar then without understanding what is written, or without thinking the approach is adaptable to you do the same copy-paste if that solution doesn't work move ahead with the next solution for you and the saga continues.

My point is not forcing you to stop looking to online resources the main point is to understand its roots clearly, don't give up so quickly, and check the log for additional information. Even a simple semicolon or space sometimes drains a lot of time and effort.

**3\. By don't following programming practices**

Did you do any of these practices while writing coding

*   Proper commenting in coding
*   Using proper and meaningful naming conventions(class, variables, etc‚Ä¶)
*   Segmenting the code properly
*   Avoiding too much nesting which is hard to read
*   Proper usage of the DRY(Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself) principle. It means that in certain situations you want to use the same functionality in different modules. So, you should not write such automated tasks repeatedly.
*   Structure your project
*   Proper documentation

If you are not following these conventions in the bigger project it will be a great mess. I can assure you that this is not the right mentality for a programmer.

### **How do solve this habitual¬†mistake?**

Great news you can cure this mistake simply by these steps:

*   Watch 1 or 2 tutorials then understand the way of doing it. Stop following too many tutorials.
*   Find a project idea
*   Try to structure and plan all features you needed
*   Prioritize the tasks
*   Step by step start to build your code
*   Implement best programming practices and document each, but don't get into it too much when beginning because sometimes it may high chance of creating boredom and result in a lack of interest. Learn and slowly pick up on every new project.
*   If the error happens try to look into Log for more details and understand it. Try to do it on your own. If stucks get opinions from others(community, developers, friends, StackOverflow).
*   Most importantly try to be consistent and always try to follow these steps and do more projects. You can choose more options like contributing open-source, freelancing always helps. So doing more practice and consistency always make difference.

Kudos to all the readers. I think this small piece of information will help all the developers to find their habitual mistakes and help to break the infinite loop which costs lots of effort and time.

That‚Äôs all for this.üëãüëãüëã
