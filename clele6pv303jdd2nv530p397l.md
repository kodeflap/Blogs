# Android Beginnerâ€™s Essential Prerequisites

Planning to get started in Android development? To build a strong building it's important to lay a foundation.

If you are planning to get started, take a look at the core concepts that I will be discussing here. Please keep up with this article and find out whether you are familiar with this concept if not try to spend some minutes catch-up with this concept for your smooth android dev journey. Letâ€™s not create further ado, letâ€™s get startedâ€¦â€¦..

### 1\. Basic Programming Knowledge

So to get a smooth ride in android development basic tech knowledge is important. You should know on

*   Variables
*   Data Types
*   Operators
*   Keywords
*   Decision Making
*   Loops
*   Arrays
*   Strings
*   Functions
*   File

A basic understanding of concepts will help to boost android development.

### 2\. OOPsÂ Concepts

Learning OOPs will create a huge impact on your Android development. So if we didnâ€™t know about class, objects, etcâ€¦, it will become really hard to understand whatâ€™s it all about, what actions are taking place, and what is its purpose? So, to get a better idea of it you should have known these concepts:

*   Class
*   Object
*   Inheritance
*   Abstraction
*   Encapsulation
*   Polymorphism

### 3\. Choose a language andÂ IDE

For Android development, we have many choices of language depending on the type of mobile app you want to create. I have already created an article on a basic overview of Android Development. You can check out for further details about types of mobile apps, languages, and IDEs.

[**Android development a basic overview**  
*Are you planning to start your android dev journey? We see a lot of apps on mobiles, tablets, smartwatches, smart TVâ€¦*medium.com](https://medium.com/@KodeFlap/android-development-a-basic-overview-91105ecc742d "https://medium.com/@KodeFlap/android-development-a-basic-overview-91105ecc742d")[](https://medium.com/@KodeFlap/android-development-a-basic-overview-91105ecc742d)

So, my series is about Android application development I will be focusing on ***Kotlin***. You can choose Java because java is no longer android official language I will be exploring its Kotlin side version

In the case of IDEs, I will be using the ***Android studio***

### **4\. Android App Components**

App components are essential building blocks of the android app. They have their lifecycle from creation to destruction. The main app components are as follows:

#### 1\. Activity

It is the entry point where the user sees and interacts with the apps. Usually, when we use an app we can see a lot of pictures, buttons, and other elements These pieces of UI elements are all placed and arranged in Activity.

#### **2\. Services**

The services are entry point that makes apps run in the background it cannot be seen by the user. An example of it is Music Player like Spotify, which plays songs even if it doesnâ€™t run foreground.

#### 3\. Broadcast Receivers

Broadcast Receivers are the component that responds to messages from other application or from the system itself. Examples: Alarm, Phone call, etcâ€¦

#### 4\. Content Providers

Content providers are the component that helps to provide data to your app. They help to access app data also data of other apps.

This knowledge is enough to get started, we can level up to its other section through the upcoming series. So stay tunedâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.

So, let putâ€™s some action in the next article.
