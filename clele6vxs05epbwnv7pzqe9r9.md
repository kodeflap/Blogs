# 5 Programming languages to learn in 2022.

Starting to learn a programming language in 2022? The technology world has a drastic development from 1883 when the first programming language was developed to 2022. The evolution of computers and supported languages have undergone a remarkable change. The technology world always waiting for welcoming its next new change. This acceptance of technology has paved the path for many new languages.

There are more than 700 programming languages now existing until this day. So choosing which language to be best and what to be studied is a very tiresome process. This article is for all the newbies who wanted to step into their development career. Programming can be started at any age. ***The correct time to study programming is now.*** No age limit to start programming. Just focus on the goal, and learning with passion and interest is the key to unleashing any new passion and interest in you.

So following are my prefernces to start programming in 2022. The suggestion is purely based on mostly used language for tech companies and still in the track of development and most preferred by many. So let's get started.

### **1\. Python**

It is one of the great choices for programming languages when coming to competitive coding and development. One of the main reasons Python is a great pick for a newbie or professional it is easy to learn the language type. It is the best choice if you have to learn the code in the shortest period. As it is a language preferred for the shortest period, deep understanding in vast areas will be a question mark.

**Advantages of using python**

*   Easy to learn.
*   Write less, do more (Simple Syntax).
*   Integration with other popular languages C and C++.
*   Extensive library supports.

**Applications of Python language**

*   Back end Development
*   Data Science
*   Machine Learning
*   Game development
*   Embedded applications

**Companies using Python**

*   Youtube
*   Facebook
*   Netflix
*   Spotify etc…

### 2\. C / C++

C is said to be the base of many languages. Learning fundamentals to advanced concept C is best in terms and also C++ which is its derived language format. So if you are aiming to make your concepts strong and you want to lay a strong foundation in software development then you can go for it. If you become a pro in C/C++ it is easy that you can understand other languages easily.

**Advantages of using C/C++**

*   Help to understand how the computer operates.
*   Easier to learn other languages.
*   Efficient programming language.
*   Help to produce efficient programs.

**Applications of C/C++ language**

*   Browsers
*   Gaming
*   Developing Operating System
*   Compilers
*   Device Drivers

**Companies using C/C++**

*   Microsoft
*   Google
*   Netflix
*   NASA etc…

### 3\. Java

It is said to be a powerful programming language. When it comes to a beginner comparatively it requires more coding when compared to other languages. But it is also a great choice in terms of development because learning Java helps in multiple developments like web, desktop, mobile, cloud, etc…

**Advantages of using Java**

*   Easy to learn
*   Platform Independent
*   Object-Oriented
*   Support automatic garbage

**Applications of Java language**

*   App development
*   Web Development
*   Desktop app development
*   Game Development

**Companies using Java**

*   Amazon
*   Adobe
*   Flipkart
*   Instagram etc…

### 4\. JavaScript

It comes as a great choice when we want to learn a program with fun. It helps in creating both front-end and also in back-end development. It is a language that supports *event-driven* programming. The flow of code is controlled by user or system events. It is also considered to be beginner-level programming once you have deep knowledge you will be capable to pick up other languages.

**Advantages of using JavaScript**

*   Great foundational language.
*   Fun and interactive language.
*   A low threshold to get started.
*   Great debugging tools

**Applications of JavaScript language**

*   Web Apps
*   Mobile Apps
*   Game development
*   Web Servers.
*   Presentations
*   Smartwatch Apps

**Companies using JavaScript**

*   PayPal
*   Uber
*   Walmart
*   Microsoft etc…

### 5\. Kaitlin

When it comes to simplicity and more productivity we can choose Kotlin. It has more beginner-friendly syntax and is concise. But thinking about beginner-friendly criteria Kotlin is best when we know the fundamentals. That is why I put it as the last priority for beginners.

**Advantages of using Kotlin**

*   It is more concise.
*   Multi-platform.
*   Null reference elimination.
*   Less chance of bugs.

**Applications of Kotlin language**

*   Back end Development
*   Front end Development
*   App development
*   Data science

**Companies using Kotlin**

*   Evernote
*   Zomato
*   Pinterest
*   Swiggy

### Conclusion

> If you are a newbie whether a student, a person who wanted to switch their career, or a technology explorer, the above-mentioned programming languages are the best choices for you. If your goal is to cover programming in a short period then Python is the best choice, but if your goal is to lay a strong foundation then learning C/C++ is the best choice, then switching over to another language will be easy. The above-picked programming language is based on a simpler approach and helps to dive deep into the programming concepts. Choosing a language is the only first step, better developers are developed through constant practice and correct application of the concepts. Let's take the time to learn by exploring.

> Happy Coding days…….
